Conceived and initiated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), this landmark prospective longitudinal study aims to transform our understanding of the genetic and environmental factors impacting neurodevelopment and their roles in behavioral and health outcomes across ten years of adolescence @volkow2018.\n\n\"Studies investigating trajectories of depressive symptoms @gao2021, @kaup2016, @lin2023, @zhang2022. Musliner et al. (2016) @musliner2016 conducted a systematic review on the heterogeneity in long-term patterns of depressive symptoms and found that most of these studies identified three or four different symptom trajectories and sampled the general population.\"\n\n\"A valuable tool for investigating heterogeneity in symptom patterns is Latent Growth Curve Modelling (GCM), a statistical method that analyses inter-individual variability in intra-individual patterns over time @curran2010. One specific type of GCM is Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), which considers unobserved heterogeneity (different groups) over time within a larger population @jung2008, @nguena2020, @ram2009. In other words, LCGA can examine the growth and shape of the course of depressive symptoms over time and assess how individuals in the population group together based on their symptom patterns.\"\n\n\"The aim of the present study is to investigate the course of depressive symptoms over a period of xx years .... and to .... . To achieve this goal, LGCM will be performed on data from the xxxx ABCD cohort (add citation). The ABCD study was initiated in xxxxx. Based on previous literature @musliner2016, we hypothesize that three or four trajectories of depression can be identified. Given that xxxxx, we additionally hypothesize that individuals following more xxxx trajectories will be more/less likely to experience xxxx and exhibit reduced levels of xxxxx\"\n\n# Methods\n\n## Design and participants\n\nParticipants were enrolled in the ongoing, longitudinal ABCD Study. The ABCD Study recruited a cohort of n=11,880 participants born between 2006-2008 and aged approximately 9-10 years at baseline, each with a parent/guardian. The study sample was recruited from households in defined catchment areas for each of the 21 (originally 22) study sites across the United States. The present study examines data from the fifth public release of ABCD Study data (version 5.1, released xxxx 202x https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/abcd). Institutional review boards at participating universities approved all study procedures. Participants provided written assent, and their legal guardians written consent, for participation. Information regarding funding agencies, recruitment sites, investigators, and project organizations can be obtained at https://abcdstudy.org. The ABCD Study design is described in more detail in @garavan2018 and @dick2021.\n\n\\[baseline (T0) measurement; follow-up measurements (T1) (T2)(T3)(T4)\\]\n\n## Measures\n\n### Depression\n\nDepression was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a widely used parent-report questionnaire designed to identify problem behavior in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years @achenbach2000. The CBCL is comprised of various scales that measure different aspects of emotional and behavioral problems. Specifically, the Depressive Problems scale, which is part of the broader Internalizing Problems domain, was utilized to measure symptoms of depression. This scale includes items that assess a range of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, lack of interest in activities, and excessive guilt or feelings of worthlessness. Respondents (parents or primary caregivers) were asked to rate how true each item was for their child over the past six months on a 3-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not true) to 2 (very true or often true). The scores from the relevant items were summed to create a composite score for depressive symptoms, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms @goldstone2020. CBCL symptom scores below the 93rd percentile (T = 65) are considered normal, scores between the 93-97th percentile (T = 65--69) are borderline clinical, and any score above the 97th percentile (T = 69) are in the clinical range @maruish2004. Scores in the borderline range are high enough to be of concern @maruish2004. The CBCL has demonstrated strong psychometric properties @achenbach2000 and its use in assessing depressive symptoms is supported by numerous studies, including those using ABCD Study data @barch2018, @goldstone2020, @gorham2019, @hoffman2019\n\n### Add other measures\n\n### Potential confounders\n\nTo account for the potentially confounding effects of attentional, cognitive, or emotional difficulties that are often comorbid with depression, all analyses included CBCL DSM-oriented xxx problems and xxx problems subscale scores as covariates. We also covaried for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and parental education.\n\n## Analytic Plan\n\n### Descriptive Statistics\n\nParticipants with CBCL depression scores at one or more time point(s) were included in the trajectory analysis. Groups with and without any missing scores on the depression outcome at each time point were compared.\n\n### Trajectory Models\n\nVariability in depressive symptom trajectories was examined using latent class growth analysis (LCGA; @jung2008, @andruff2009, @berlin2014, @wardenaar2020). LCGA is a person-centered method that identifies latent classes of individuals sharing similar developmental patterns, thereby facilitating an examination of individual patterns of stability and change across time @jung2008, @nguena2020, @ram2009. Prior research (@musliner2016) suggests three to six distinct depressive trajectory subgroups, prompting the estimation of models ranging from one to seven classes. To capture changes in depressive symptomatology over time, both linear and quadratic terms were considered. Differentiation among trajectories regarding intercept, slope, and step was evaluated using Wald tests. An examination of the data revealed a skewed distribution, notably inflated at the scale's lower end. Initial analyses resulted in LCGA model convergence issues due to this skewness. As such, a Box-Cox transformation was implemented (See Fig. xx) to improve the ability to examine patterns of heterogeneity in more detail. To evaluate the effect of covariates, we adhered to a commonly applied, three-step approach which accounts for classification errors of the model @vermunt2010. This method estimates an auxiliary model based on latent classification, assigning group-specific BCH weights to cases (@bolck2004). \n\nNext, an omnibus likelihood ratio test was examined to test for significant differences in trajectory patterns. For all omnibus likelihood ratio tests the p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. If the omnibus test was still significant after correction, post hoc test results were obtained and likewise subjected to correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.ll analyses were performed using the programming language R (version 4.2.2, package for trajectory analysis: tidySEM, @van2023) (with significance level set at p \\< .05 (two-tailed)). All R code is made publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/OpenDevSci/SUNLab.\n\nIdentification of the best fitting model was based on a combination of interpretability, parsimony, and theoretical justification @nagin2010, @nguena2020, @ram2009. Key metrics for assessing model fit include Information Criteria (IC) such as the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), the sample-size-adjusted BIC (saBIC), and the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), with a preference for models that register the lowest IC values @nylund2007, @van2020, @van2023. In cases of ambiguous and contradictory ICs, evaluation of a scree plot's inflection point may assist in determining the point beyond which additional classes offer negligible improvement to IC reduction @nylund2018. Model performance was appraised through a range of indicators including entropy, posterior classification probability (the likelihood of an individual's correct class assignment), and class size. Solutions yielding distinct classes were prioritized to facilitate clear interpretation. High entropy values signify well-differentiated classes @van2023, @weller2020; thus, configurations with entropy below .90 were excluded. Moreover, when an individual’s posterior classification probability is distinctly high for one class compared to others, it denotes effective class differentiation by the model @andruff2009. Criteria set for acceptable solutions included an average posterior classification probability exceeding .90 @weller2020. Additionally, drawing on prior studies, a minimum class size of 50 individuals or 5% of the overall sample was deemed necessary to ensure representativeness @muthen2000, @weller2020, leading to the exclusion of classes not meeting this threshold.\n\nData processing and analysis were executed using the tidySEM package in R @van2023, employing [full information maximum likelihood estimation to accommodate standard errors and provide a chi-square statistic robust to non-normality(?)]. Complex sampling and recruitment procedures for the ABCD Study were accounted for using cluster correction (i.e., for sibling pairs) and stratification sampling (i.e. study site) procedures.\n\n## Depression symptoms associations with the GDT & substance use\n\nTo get more insights in the trajectories and associated outcomes (e.g., GDT, substance use), we assessed xxxxx between the different classes. We used the same three-step approach with the omnibus likelihood test used for the covariates and the results were also corrected for multiple comparisons. All participants reported xxxx during xxxx.\n\n## Add additional analyses section\n\n# Results\n\n### Descriptive Statistics\n\nDescriptive statistics revealed that the study groups were equivalent on demographic variables, except for lower proportional representation of female and Hispanic children in the xxxx groups (see Table 1). This study included xxx participants (xxx \\[xx.xx%\\] women, xxx \\[xx.xx\\] men); mean (SD) XXX was xx.xx (x.xx). Table 1 provides other demographic characteristics, including race, family income, parental education attainment for each trajectory pattern. Moreover, there were no significant differences between participants missing any depression measurements and participants with complete depression scores at each time point. \n\n### Trajectory Models\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Item descriptives\n\n|name      |     mean| median|       sd| min| max| skew_2se| kurt_2se|\n|:---------|--------:|------:|--------:|---:|---:|--------:|--------:|\n|depress.0 | 53.60388|     50| 5.730277|  50|  89| 43.25937| 73.03183|\n|depress.1 | 53.91671|     51| 6.091272|  50|  89| 40.55937| 67.51372|\n|depress.2 | 53.74756|     51| 5.879662|  50|  89| 34.89586| 58.92123|\n|depress.3 | 54.07339|     51| 6.202545|  50|  91| 32.14011| 53.74958|\n|depress.4 | 53.98760|     51| 6.389056|  50|  96| 27.29848| 47.96809|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can examine these distributions visually as well:\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scratch_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs this type of skew can result in convergence problems in LCGA, we compared several transformations to reduce skew: The square and cube root, log, inverse, and Box-Cox transformations.\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe can plot these transformations:\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scratch_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Box-Cox transformation (maybe/slightly?) reduced skew the most.

A selection of characteristics and fit statistics is presented in Table 2 for the linear models. All quadratic models, except the one-class quadratic model, encountered convergence problems and failed to find a final solution. This suggests that the quadratic models are too complex for our dataset @van2023. While it is feasible to explore alternative non-linear patterns, the persisting issue lies in the apparent complexity associated with models incorporating many parameters. For the linear models, a reduction in BIC, saBIC and AIC was observed with increasing class number. The reduction in ICs flattened after three classes. In addition, the LoMendell-Rubin (LMR) likelihood ratio test was significant with every additional class and entropy was above.90 for all models. Posterior group probability was acceptable (above.90) up to the four-class model. Therefore, the models with five or more classes were not accepted. For all models with one to four classes, the class size was larger than 5% and consisted of at least 50 individuals. Altogether, most quadratic models did not converge, and both the three- and four-class model performed well and had acceptable classification performance. Therefore, we selected the linear three-class model as the final model.\n\n#### Depression trajectories\n\nThe three classes identified were a xx class with xx participants (xx%), an xx class with xx participants (xx%), and a xx class with xx participants (xx%) (Fig. x). The xxx group showed low levels of depressive symptoms xxxx. The xxx and xxx group showed a significant increase in depressive symptoms. The xxxx group started xxxx, and showed a significant xxxxx. Results of the Wald tests (Supplementary Table S8) showed that the xxxxx scores for depressive symptoms (intercepts) and the increase from xxxx differed significantly between all classes (p \\< .01). Furthermore, the trajectories differed significantly in slope (p \\< .01). (See Supplement for pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction).\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n\n:::\n\n\nNote that the first model showed convergence problems, throwing the error: The model does not satisfy the first-order optimality conditions to the required accuracy, and no improved point for the merit function could be found during the final linesearch. To address this problem, we performed additional iterations to find a better solution, using OpenMx::mxTryHardWideSearch(). This also illustrates that tidySEM mixture models inherit from OpenMx's MxModel, and thus, different OpenMx functions can be used to act on models specified via tidySEM.\n\nThe fifth model also evidenced convergence problems, but this (as we will see) is because the solution is overfitted.\n\nClass enumeration To determine the correct number of classes, we considered the following criteria:\n\nWe do not consider classes with, on average, fewer than 5 participants per parameter in a class due to potential local underidentification Lower values for information criteria (AIC, BIC, saBIC) indicate better fit Significant Lo-Mendell-Rubin LRT test indicates better fit for 𝑘 vs 𝑘−1 classes We do not consider solutions with entropy \\< .90 because poor class separability compromises interpretability of the results We do not consider solutions with minimum posterior classification probability \\< .90 because poor class separability compromises interpretability of the results\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  Name Classes       LL Parameters        AIC        BIC      saBIC   Entropy\n1    1       1 3093.653          8  -6171.307  -6120.101  -6145.522 1.0000000\n2    2       2 8114.557         12 -16205.115 -16128.307 -16166.438 0.9391755\n3    3       3 9166.613         16 -18301.226 -18198.815 -18249.657 0.9076713\n   prob_min      n_min\n1 1.0000000 1.00000000\n2 0.9521787 0.20337079\n3 0.8918387 0.09775281\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAccording to the Table, increasing the number of classes keeps improving model fit according to all ICs.\n\nThe first two LMR tests are significant, indicating that a 2- and 3-class solution were a significant improvement over a 1- and 2-class solution, respectively. However, solutions with \\>3 classes had entropy and minimum posterior classification probability below the pre-specified thresholds. Models with \\>3 solutions also had fewer than five observations per parameter. This suggests that the preferred model should be selected from 1-3 classes.\n\nScree plot A scree plot indicates that the largest decrease in ICs occurs from 1-2 classes, and the inflection point for all ICs is at 3 classes. Moreover, the BIC increased after 3 classes. A three-class solution thus appears to be the most parsimonious solution with good fit.\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scratch_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the aforementioned criteria, we selected a 3-class model for further analyses.

This can help interpret the results better, as well as the residual heterogeneity around class trajectories.\n\n\n::: {.cell messages='false'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Using shapes for an ordinal variable is not advised\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](scratch_files/figure-docx/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the observed individual trajectories show very high variability within classes.\n\n#### Covariates\n\nAssessment of covariates using the three-step approach revealed that the trajectories did not differ in any of the demogra phical variables, including sex (ΔLL(5) = 6.3 , p = .27, pcorr = .37), age (ΔLL(8) = 8.4 , p = .40, pcorr = .50), rank Journal of Affective Disorders 354 (2024) 702--711 707(ΔLL(11) = 13.5 , p = .26, pcorr = .37), educational level (ΔLL(9) = 7.1 , p = .63, pcorr = .66), function (ΔLL(8) = 8.1 , p = .43, pcorr = .51), year of deployment (ΔLL(5) = 3.6 , p = .61, pcorr = 66), or previous deployments (ΔLL(6) = 3.0 , p = .81, pcorr = .81). For early life traumas, the symptomatic-chronic group experienced more early life traumas compared to the other trajectories (p \\< .01, pcorr \\< .01) and both the resilient and late-onset-increasing group experienced significantly less early life traumas compared to the intermediate-stable group (ΔLL(2) = 21.6 , p \\< .01, pcorr \\< .01; ΔLL(2) = 8.1 , p \\< .05, pcorr \\< .05) (Supple- mentary Fig. S10). Significant disparities in the number of deployment stressors were observed, with the resilient group exhibiting lower counts of deploy- ment stressors compared to the intermediate-stable group (ΔLL(2) = 23.0 , p \\< .01, pcorr \\< .01), symptomic-chronic group (ΔLL(2) = 325.7 , p \\< .01, pcorr \\< .01), and late-onset-increasing group (ΔLL(2) = 9.5 , p \\< .01, pcorr \\< .05) (Supplementary Fig. S11).
