This document is designed to help you navigate and effectively use GitHub Codespaces for the midFEMA project, focusing on basic R analysis and Quarto for writing-ups. It’s tailored for collaborators with minimal background in Codespaces, VS Code, IDEs, development containers, Docker environments, etc.\n\n\nBefore we jump into the setup, let’s clarify what Codespaces and Dev Containers are and how they benefit your development workflow:\n\n\nThink of Dev Containers as VS Code running inside Docker. They allow you to define a development environment with a Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml, enabling you to run your project in that environment seamlessly—both locally and in the cloud.\n\n\n\nGitHub Codespaces are Dev Containers but hosted in the cloud. Accessed through VS Code, they use Dev Containers configurations to provide a powerful, cloud-based development environment.\n\n\n\nThe combination of VS Code, Dev Containers, and GitHub Codespaces allows you to develop from almost anywhere, on any machine.

I think a hiring manager would be more interested in your ability to produce maintainable, robust, high-quality software and write strong, technical documentation and result reporting that describes how you did your analysis over the nuances of how you name your folders.”\nI agree, a good readme is critical and often a good indicator of a well-tracked repo. You will thank yourself later in the future as well for having well-documented, reproducible code.\nDon’t put data or output in your repo, just scripts. Have your Readme summarize each script, and the order they should be run if applicable.\nIf you really want to show output, have an html from an rmd output.\nAs a beginner, what setup currently works for me is:\nInitialize a Git repository\nCreate folders data, results, scripts and notebooks (nowadays I also create a reports folder to store RMarkdown reports, but that may be a subject of taste). Put the contents of data and results folders into .gitignore. Thus, only the code and documentation are versioned (however, the structure inside the data folders also matters for code readability)\nI start the analysis in notebooks. Once a chunk of workflow (e.g., sample QC) is completed, I refactor the code, test it again and separate the logical parts into individual scripts. Then I test that sequence of scripts. If everything works fine, I delete the notebook (I personally do not like how notebooks interact with Git. If I want to showcase the code together with the results, I prefer RMarkdown)\nRight now I’m working on improving my documentation practices. I think going with a README with a general description of the project, outline of main steps in your scripts and their order (e.g., PROJECT.md) and DATA.md which summarizes where you got the data you use\nPrivate repos. You could also set up a Jupyter-book with collaborators.\nIf you are a student, register for a student acct.\nOthers have mentioned that if you use a private repo, you should avoid uploading actual data files to the github. This is the .gitignore file I use to ensure that:\nhttps://learngitbranching.js.org/\nhttps://git-scm.com/book/en/v2\nOther lab resources r tidyverse wickham easystats how to use"
