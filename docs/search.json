(2016) conducted a systematic review on the heterogeneity in long-term patterns of depressive symptoms and found that most of these studies identified three or four different symptom trajectories and sampled the general population.‚Äù\n‚ÄúA valuable tool for investigating heterogeneity in symptom patterns is Latent Growth Curve Modelling (GCM), a statistical method that analyses inter-individual variability in intra-individual patterns over time Curran, Obeidat, and Losardo (2010). One specific type of GCM is Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), which considers unobserved heterogeneity (different groups) over time within a larger population Jung and Wickrama (2008), Nguena Nguefack et al. (2020), Ram and Grimm (2009). In other words, LCGA can examine the growth and shape of the course of depressive symptoms over time and assess how individuals in the population group together based on their symptom patterns.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe aim of the present study is to investigate the course of depressive symptoms over a period of xx years ‚Ä¶. and to ‚Ä¶. .

    "text": "2.2 Measures\n\n2.2.1 Depression\nDepression was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a widely used parent-report questionnaire designed to identify problem behavior in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years Achenbach, Ruffle, et al. (2000). The CBCL is comprised of various scales that measure different aspects of emotional and behavioral problems. Specifically, the Depressive Problems scale, which is part of the broader Internalizing Problems domain, was utilized to measure symptoms of depression. This scale includes items that assess a range of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, lack of interest in activities, and excessive guilt or feelings of worthlessness. Respondents (parents or primary caregivers) were asked to rate how true each item was for their child over the past six months on a 3-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not true) to 2 (very true or often true). The scores from the relevant items were summed to create a composite score for depressive symptoms, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms Goldstone et al. (2020). CBCL symptom scores below the 93rd percentile (T = 65) are considered normal, scores between the 93-97th percentile (T = 65‚Äì69) are borderline clinical, and any score above the 97th percentile (T = 69) are in the clinical range Maruish (2004). Scores in the borderline range are high enough to be of concern Maruish (2004). The CBCL has demonstrated strong psychometric properties Achenbach, Ruffle, et al. (2000) and its use in assessing depressive symptoms is supported by numerous studies, including those using ABCD Study data Barch et al. (2018), Goldstone et al. (2020), Gorham et al.

(2019)\n\n\n2.2.2 Add other measures\n\n\n2.2.3 Potential confounders\nTo account for the potentially confounding effects of attentional, cognitive, or emotional difficulties that are often comorbid with depression, all analyses included CBCL DSM-oriented xxx problems and xxx problems subscale scores as covariates.

    "text": "2.3 Analytic Plan\n\n2.3.1 Descriptive Statistics\nParticipants with CBCL depression scores at one or more time point(s) were included in the trajectory analysis. Groups with and without any missing scores on the depression outcome at each time point were compared.\n\n\n2.3.2 Trajectory Models\nVariability in depressive symptom trajectories was examined using latent class growth analysis (LCGA; Jung and Wickrama (2008), Andruff et al. (2009), Berlin, Williams, and Parra (2014), Wardenaar (2020)). LCGA is a person-centered method that identifies latent classes of individuals sharing similar developmental patterns, thereby facilitating an examination of individual patterns of stability and change across time Jung and Wickrama (2008), Nguena Nguefack et al. (2020), Ram and Grimm (2009). Prior research (Musliner et al. (2016)) suggests three to six distinct depressive trajectory subgroups, prompting the estimation of models ranging from one to seven classes. To capture changes in depressive symptomatology over time, both linear and quadratic terms were considered. Differentiation among trajectories regarding intercept, slope, and step was evaluated using Wald tests. An examination of the data revealed a skewed distribution, notably inflated at the scale‚Äôs lower end. Initial analyses resulted in LCGA model convergence issues due to this skewness. As such, a Box-Cox transformation was implemented (See Fig. xx) to improve the ability to examine patterns of heterogeneity in more detail. To evaluate the effect of covariates, we adhered to a commonly applied, three-step approach which accounts for classification errors of the model Vermunt (2010). This method estimates an auxiliary model based on latent classification, assigning group-specific BCH weights to cases (Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004)).\nNext, an omnibus likelihood ratio test was examined to test for significant differences in trajectory patterns. For all omnibus likelihood ratio tests the p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. If the omnibus test was still significant after correction, post hoc test results were obtained and likewise subjected to correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.ll analyses were performed using the programming language R (version 4.2.2, package for trajectory analysis: tidySEM, Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023)) (with significance level set at p &lt; .05 (two-tailed)). All R code is made publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/OpenDevSci/SUNLab.\nIdentification of the best fitting model was based on a combination of interpretability, parsimony, and theoretical justification Nagin and Odgers (2010), Nguena Nguefack et al. (2020), Ram and Grimm (2009). Key metrics for assessing model fit include Information Criteria (IC) such as the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), the sample-size-adjusted BIC (saBIC), and the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), with a preference for models that register the lowest IC values Nylund, Asparouhov, and Muth√©n (2007), Nest et al. (2020), Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023). In cases of ambiguous and contradictory ICs, evaluation of a scree plot‚Äôs inflection point may assist in determining the point beyond which additional classes offer negligible improvement to IC reduction Nylund-Gibson and Choi (2018). Model performance was appraised through a range of indicators including entropy, posterior classification probability (the likelihood of an individual‚Äôs correct class assignment), and class size. Solutions yielding distinct classes were prioritized to facilitate clear interpretation. High entropy values signify well-differentiated classes Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023), Weller, Bowen, and Faubert (2020); thus, configurations with entropy below .90 were excluded. Moreover, when an individual‚Äôs posterior classification probability is distinctly high for one class compared to others, it denotes effective class differentiation by the model Andruff et al. (2009). Criteria set for acceptable solutions included an average posterior classification probability exceeding .90 Weller, Bowen, and Faubert (2020). Additionally, drawing on prior studies, a minimum class size of 50 individuals or 5% of the overall sample was deemed necessary to ensure representativeness Muth√©n and Muth√©n (2000), Weller, Bowen, and Faubert (2020), leading to the exclusion of classes not meeting this threshold.\nData processing and analysis were executed using the tidySEM package in R Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023), employing [full information maximum likelihood estimation to accommodate standard errors and provide a chi-square statistic robust to non-normality(?)]. Complex sampling and recruitment procedures for the ABCD Study were accounted for using cluster correction (i.e., for sibling pairs) and stratification sampling (i.e.¬†study site) procedures."

    "text": "Methods and Materials\nParticipants and Procedure\nThis study consisted of XX participants (age range XX, mean XX; XX% female; XX% White, XX% Black, XX% Asian, XX% other; XX% non-Hispanic and XX% Hispanic) enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The ABCD study consisted of annual follow-up visits (Baseline, Y1, Y2, Y3, etc.). Participants and their parents/guardians were recruited from 21 research sites across the U.S. between 2016-2018. The participants were recruited through probability sampling of U.S. schools within the 21 catchment areas. The American Community Survey (ACS) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) were used to provide guidelines for a sociodemographic (age, gender, race and ethnicity, socio-economic status, and urbanicity) to represent the population of the U.S. For details see Garavan et al., (2018). All study procedures were approved by a centralized institutional review board (IRB) at the University of California, San Diego, and written informed assent/consent was provided.\nExclusion criteria for the youth participant included lack of English proficiency, the presence of severe sensory, intellectual, medial, or neurological issues that would impact the validity of the collected data or the child‚Äôs ability to comply with the study protocol, and contradictions of the MRI scanning. Exclusion criteria for the parent participant included lack of proficiency in English or Spanish. Data from the ABCD Study are made available by the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA), and the current study used data from the ABCD Curated Annual Release 5.0 (10.15154/8873-zj65) released June 16, 2023.\nAnnual visits consisted of 1-2 study sessions, which included biological, behavioral, and neuroimaging assessment modules, including substance use (Lisdahl et al., 2018), mental and physical health (Barch et al., 2018), peer, family, culture, and environment (Zucker et al., 2018), biological markers (Uban at al., 2018), genetics (Iacono et al., 2018), neurocognitive (Luciana et al., 2018), and magnetic resonance imaging (Casey et al., 2018). For the current study, neurocognitive and activity data were obtained at the 2-year follow-up timepoint, and substance use measures were obtained during the 4-year follow-up timepoint. Sociodemographic information was collected from the parent participants (family income, highest parental education, child‚Äôs ethnicity and race, and child‚Äôs sex assigned at birth) (Garavan et al., 2018).\nADD IN THE SU GROUPINGS\nMeasures\nSubstance Use\nConfidentiality was reiterated to the youth before the substance use interview. At the baseline assessment the youth were asked about lifetime use, and each follow-up visit proceeding the youth were asked about substance use since the last follow up visit (Lisdahl et al., 2018). The substance use module consisted of each major drug category: alcohol, cannabis and cannabinoids (smoked cannabis, edible cannabis, cannabis concentrates, cannabis-infused alcohol, cannabis tinctures, synthetic cannabinoids), nicotine (tobacco cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, hookah, tobacco pipe, nicotine replacement), caffeine, cocaine, cathinones, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy or molly), ketamine, gamma hydroxybutyrate, heroin, hallucinogens (including lysergic acid diethylamide, phencyclidine, peyote, mescaline, N-dimethyltryptamine, alpha-methyltryptamine, or 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine), psilocybin, salvia, anabolic steroids, inhalants, prescription stimulants, prescription sedatives, prescription opioids, and OTC cough or cold medicine (Lisdahl et al., 2018).\nSubstance use experimentation was a measurement of less than one standard drink of alcohol and a puff or taste of cannabis or nicotine or any other occasion of other substance use (Lisdahl et al., 2018). The iSay Sipping Inventory, an 8-item instrument, was used to measure first experiences sipping alcohol (age of onset, type of alcohol, context in which the sipping occurred, who the drink belonged to, and if the drink was offered or not) (Jackson et al., 2015). Similar information was acquired for cannabis and nicotine (where they obtained the substance, when the experience occurred, and whether it led to further use); potency and subjective experience of feeling ‚Äúhigh‚Äù were also assessed (Lisdahl et al., 2018). For youth who reported a full standard unit of a substance, the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB) was administered (Lisdahl et al., 2018; Sobell and Sobell, 1992). The TLFB is a semi-structured interview that uses a calendar to retrospectively recall lifetime substance use and substance use between visits (Lisdahl et al., 2018; Robinson et al., 2014). The current study mimicked the characterization of substance use from a previous study, Sullivan et al., 2022, by using the following two categories: initiation: reported ‚â•1 standard alcohol drink, &gt;puff/taste cannabis or nicotine or any other occasion of other substance use; experimentation: low-level substance use (i.e., alcohol sipping, nicotine or cannabis puffing or trying) (Sullivan et al., 2022).\nActivity Measurement ‚Äì ADD IN INFORMATION ABOUT PA\nPhysical activity was assessed through wearable technology (Fitbit Charge Series) for 21 days (Bagot et al., 2018). Days were included with more than 599 daily minutes of waking wear time and minimum of 1000 daily steps (Nagata et al., 2023). Physical activity was separated into three categories with cutoffs based on standardizing analytic methods of metabolic equivalents (METs) (light activity 1.5-3.0 METs, moderate activity 3.0-6.0 METs, and vigorous activity &gt;6.0 METs) (Welk et al., 2019). Using METs provides daily profiles of activity patterns, and the physical activity can be individualized relative to fitness level (Welk et al., 2019).\nAnalysis\nADD INFORMATION ABOUT ANALYSIS ORDINAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION"
