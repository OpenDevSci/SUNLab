    "text": "The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® is the largest longitudinal investigation of neurodevelopment and child health in the United States. Conceived and initiated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), this landmark prospective longitudinal study aims to transform our understanding of the genetic and environmental factors impacting neurodevelopment and their roles in behavioral and health outcomes across ten years of adolescence Volkow et al. (2018).\n“Studies investigating trajectories of depressive symptoms Gao et al. (2021), Kaup et al. (2016), Lin et al. (2023), Zhang et al. (2022). Musliner et al. (2016) Musliner et al. (2016) conducted a systematic review on the heterogeneity in long-term patterns of depressive symptoms and found that most of these studies identified three or four different symptom trajectories and sampled the general population.”\n“A valuable tool for investigating heterogeneity in symptom patterns is Latent Growth Curve Modelling (GCM), a statistical method that analyses inter-individual variability in intra-individual patterns over time Curran, Obeidat, and Losardo (2010). One specific type of GCM is Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA), which considers unobserved heterogeneity (different groups) over time within a larger population Jung and Wickrama (2008), Nguena Nguefack et al. (2020), Ram and Grimm (2009). In other words, LCGA can examine the growth and shape of the course of depressive symptoms over time and assess how individuals in the population group together based on their symptom patterns.”\n“The aim of the present study is to investigate the course of depressive symptoms over a period of xx years …. and to …. . To achieve this goal, LGCM will be performed on data from the xxxx ABCD cohort (add citation). The ABCD study was initiated in xxxxx. Based on previous literature Musliner et al. (2016), we hypothesize that three or four trajectories of depression can be identified. Given that xxxxx, we additionally hypothesize that individuals following more xxxx trajectories will be more/less likely to experience xxxx and exhibit reduced levels of xxxxx”"

The ABCD Study recruited a cohort of n=11,880 participants born between 2006-2008 and aged approximately 9-10 years at baseline, each with a parent/guardian. The study sample was recruited from households in defined catchment areas for each of the 21 (originally 22) study sites across the United States. The present study examines data from the fifth public release of ABCD Study data (version 5.1, released xxxx 202x https://data-archive.nimh.nih.gov/abcd). Institutional review boards at participating universities approved all study procedures. Participants provided written assent, and their legal guardians written consent, for participation. Information regarding funding agencies, recruitment sites, investigators, and project organizations can be obtained at https://abcdstudy.org. The ABCD Study design is described in more detail in Garavan et al. (2018) and Dick et al. (2021).\n[baseline (T0) measurement; follow-up measurements (T1) (T2)(T3)(T4)]"

    "text": "2.2 Measures\n\n2.2.1 Depression\nDepression was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a widely used parent-report questionnaire designed to identify problem behavior in children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years Achenbach, Ruffle, et al. (2000). The CBCL is comprised of various scales that measure different aspects of emotional and behavioral problems. Specifically, the Depressive Problems scale, which is part of the broader Internalizing Problems domain, was utilized to measure symptoms of depression. This scale includes items that assess a range of depressive symptoms such as persistent sadness, lack of interest in activities, and excessive guilt or feelings of worthlessness. Respondents (parents or primary caregivers) were asked to rate how true each item was for their child over the past six months on a 3-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not true) to 2 (very true or often true). The scores from the relevant items were summed to create a composite score for depressive symptoms, with higher scores indicating greater severity of depressive symptoms Goldstone et al. (2020). CBCL symptom scores below the 93rd percentile (T = 65) are considered normal, scores between the 93-97th percentile (T = 65–69) are borderline clinical, and any score above the 97th percentile (T = 69) are in the clinical range Maruish (2004). Scores in the borderline range are high enough to be of concern Maruish (2004). The CBCL has demonstrated strong psychometric properties Achenbach, Ruffle, et al. (2000) and its use in assessing depressive symptoms is supported by numerous studies, including those using ABCD Study data Barch et al. (2018), Goldstone et al. (2020), Gorham et al. (2019), Hoffman et al. (2019)\n\n\n2.2.2 Add other measures\n\n\n2.2.3 Potential confounders\nTo account for the potentially confounding effects of attentional, cognitive, or emotional difficulties that are often comorbid with depression, all analyses included CBCL DSM-oriented xxx problems and xxx problems subscale scores as covariates. We also covaried for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and parental education."

    "text": "2.3 Analytic Plan\n\n2.3.1 Descriptive Statistics\nParticipants with CBCL depression scores at one or more time point(s) were included in the trajectory analysis. Groups with and without any missing scores on the depression outcome at each time point were compared.\n\n\n2.3.2 Trajectory Models\nVariability in depressive symptom trajectories was examined using latent class growth analysis (LCGA; Jung and Wickrama (2008), Andruff et al. (2009), Berlin, Williams, and Parra (2014), Wardenaar (2020)). LCGA is a person-centered method that identifies latent classes of individuals sharing similar developmental patterns, thereby facilitating an examination of individual patterns of stability and change across time Jung and Wickrama (2008), Nguena Nguefack et al. (2020), Ram and Grimm (2009). Prior research (Musliner et al. (2016)) suggests three to six distinct depressive trajectory subgroups, prompting the estimation of models ranging from one to seven classes. To capture changes in depressive symptomatology over time, both linear and quadratic terms were considered. Differentiation among trajectories regarding intercept, slope, and step was evaluated using Wald tests. An examination of the data revealed a skewed distribution, notably inflated at the scale’s lower end. Initial analyses resulted in LCGA model convergence issues due to this skewness. As such, a Box-Cox transformation was implemented (See Fig. xx) to improve the ability to examine patterns of heterogeneity in more detail. To evaluate the effect of covariates, we adhered to a commonly applied, three-step approach which accounts for classification errors of the model Vermunt (2010). This method estimates an auxiliary model based on latent classification, assigning group-specific BCH weights to cases (Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (2004)).\nNext, an omnibus likelihood ratio test was examined to test for significant differences in trajectory patterns. For all omnibus likelihood ratio tests the p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. If the omnibus test was still significant after correction, post hoc test results were obtained and likewise subjected to correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate.ll analyses were performed using the programming language R (version 4.2.2, package for trajectory analysis: tidySEM, Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023)) (with significance level set at p &lt; .05 (two-tailed)). All R code is made publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/OpenDevSci/SUNLab.\nIdentification of the best fitting model was based on a combination of interpretability, parsimony, and theoretical justification Nagin and Odgers (2010), Nguena Nguefack et al. (2020), Ram and Grimm (2009). Key metrics for assessing model fit include Information Criteria (IC) such as the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC), the sample-size-adjusted BIC (saBIC), and the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), with a preference for models that register the lowest IC values Nylund, Asparouhov, and Muthén (2007), Nest et al. (2020), Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023). In cases of ambiguous and contradictory ICs, evaluation of a scree plot’s inflection point may assist in determining the point beyond which additional classes offer negligible improvement to IC reduction Nylund-Gibson and Choi (2018). Model performance was appraised through a range of indicators including entropy, posterior classification probability (the likelihood of an individual’s correct class assignment), and class size. Solutions yielding distinct classes were prioritized to facilitate clear interpretation. High entropy values signify well-differentiated classes Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023), Weller, Bowen, and Faubert (2020); thus, configurations with entropy below .90 were excluded. Moreover, when an individual’s posterior classification probability is distinctly high for one class compared to others, it denotes effective class differentiation by the model Andruff et al. (2009). Criteria set for acceptable solutions included an average posterior classification probability exceeding .90 Weller, Bowen, and Faubert (2020). Additionally, drawing on prior studies, a minimum class size of 50 individuals or 5% of the overall sample was deemed necessary to ensure representativeness Muthén and Muthén (2000), Weller, Bowen, and Faubert (2020), leading to the exclusion of classes not meeting this threshold.\nData processing and analysis were executed using the tidySEM package in R Van Lissa, Garnier-Villarreal, and Anadria (2023), employing [full information maximum likelihood estimation to accommodate standard errors and provide a chi-square statistic robust to non-normality(?)]. Complex sampling and recruitment procedures for the ABCD Study were accounted for using cluster correction (i.e., for sibling pairs) and stratification sampling (i.e. study site) procedures."
